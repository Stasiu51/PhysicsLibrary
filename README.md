# PhysicsLibrary
Basic Physics and OpenGL Graphics Library

Created in my second year of Cambridge Physics. 

It allows you to create basic shapes as well as general polygons and link them with constraints (based on inheritance from an abstract constraint), and then to watch the resulting simulation.

It exports as a DLL.
